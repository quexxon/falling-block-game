# Falling Block Game [WIP]

A Tetris clone implemented in HTML 5 Canvas. This is intended to be the first
in a series of warm-up games leading up to a bigger project. It's certainly a
work in progress. Expect an incomplete, but playable experience, for the next
few days/weeks (2017/05/20).

## Missing Features

* Next block preview
* Distinct colors for different shaped blocks
* Multiple levels with increasing speed
* Completed row counts
* Game over notification
* Start screen
* Pause
* Probably more...
